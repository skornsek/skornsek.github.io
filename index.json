I collaborated with subject experts and graphic designers. It was challenging but I loved it because I learned a lot. With the knowledge I gained, I could mentor other employees, which I really enjoy doing. Internally I ran workshops on the use of Git, first teaching the basics. Later, I talked about advanced methods of using the tool in teams and in combination with CI/CD tools. I also lectured on the use of external functions in the Snowflake database.\nProfitability # I started with the development of the Profitability web application. The application helps to calculate the profitability of client products. I used the .NET Core 2.1 framework to build the application, which is connected to a DB2 database. I used Bootstrap library and Telerik Kendo UI components for the user interface. An internal Active Directory is used for user authentication. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps that were integrated with Bitbucket. That enabled neat release tracking and simplified deployment. The application was hosted on IIS on-prem.\n.NET Core 2.1 DB2 Bootstrap Telerik Kendo UI Active Directory Bitbucket Azure DevOps IIS on-prem Codify # I continued with Codify web application, which is a lightweight and user-friendly application to manage analytical attributes, classifications and hierarchies not available in the core systems. The application is designed to run in the cloud or on-prem. It follows the principles of Clean Architecture. The backend is built with .NET Core 3.1 framework and the user interface is built using Angular 2 and Telerik Kendo UI components. The data is stored in an MSSQL database. Authentication and authorization are managed by Azure AD. The application can also be integrated with the Snowflake analytical database and we can sync data with Codify on demand from the Snowflake editor. CI/CD pipelines built in GitHub Actions ensure that automated tests are executed and that Codify is packaged in a container for each new release. Most of our clients used Azure cloud so I\u0026rsquo;m most comfortable with deployment on it. I automated the deployment of the cloud infrastructure with Terraform.\n.NET Core 3.1 MSSQL Snowflake Angular 2 Telerik Kendo UI Clean Architecture Azure AD Azure CI/CD GitHub GitHub Actions Terraform Docker Risk Appetite Automation # I also started with the development of a Risk Appetite Automation web application. The application allows visual monitoring and calculation of company KPIs, enabling the company to better control its risks. The technologies and skills required are similar to those used in the Codify product since they are very effective. Only newer versions of the frameworks are used. On this project, I have been mentoring new employees on how to set up the foundations of the application and development environment. I was the development team leader for a team of three, delegating work to them using the Jira tool and assisting them with their problems. I also made sure that things got done on time.\n.NET 6 MSSQL Angular 2 Telerik Kendo UI Clean Architecture CI/CD GitHub GitHub Actions on-prem 1. 10. 2018 â€“ 31. 5. 2019, Full stack web developer @University of Ljubljana Faculty of Computer and Information Science, Ljubljana (Slovenia) # I worked on the Studis student information system, which is designed for students of several faculties (grade insights, exam registration) and for faculty staff (learning process management, student management).\nIn the beginning, I was learning how such a system works. Then I started to fix bugs in the system and add new features. The system was built using the ASP.NET MVC framework. The user interface was made using Razor Pages and Bootstrap library.\nAt the time I was also a user of the Studis system. There was no mobile UI for the system and a lot of students complained about that including me. Therefore I suggested to the team that we develop a mobile UI. They approved my suggestion and I could start working on improving that. I upgraded the pages visible to the students to a responsive design. Through the upgrade, I learned how to create web-based user interfaces that are supported on different screen sizes.\nASP.NET MVC Responsive Web Design Bootstrap Tortoise SVN ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/work-experience/","section":"Work Experience","summary":"1. 11.","title":"Work Experience"}]

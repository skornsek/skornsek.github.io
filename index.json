I liked the challenge of it because I learned a lot of new things. Then I was able to share my knowledge with other employees through mentoring which I loved doing.\nProfitability # I started with the development of the Profitability web application. The application helps to calculate the profitability of client products. I used the .NET Core 2.1 framework to build the application, which is connected to a DB2 database. I used Bootstrap library and Telerik Kendo UI components for the user interface. An internal Active Directory is used for user authentication. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps that were integrated with Bitbucket. That enabled neat release tracking and simplified deployment. The application was hosted on IIS on-prem.\n.NET Core 2.1 DB2 Bootstrap Telerik Kendo UI Active Directory Bitbucket Azure DevOps IIS Codify # I continued with Codify web application, which is a lightweight and user-friendly application to manage analytical attributes, classifications and hierarchies not available in the core systems. The application is designed to run in the cloud or on-prem. It follows the principles of Clean Architecture. The backend is built with .NET Core 3.1 framework and the user interface is built using Angular 2 and Telerik Kendo UI components. The data is stored in an MSSQL database. Authentication and authorization are managed by Azure AD. The application can also be integrated with the Snowflake analytical database and we can sync data with Codify on demand from the Snowflake editor. CI/CD pipelines built in GitHub Actions ensure that automated tests are executed and that Codify is packaged in a container for each new release. Most of our clients used Azure cloud so I\u0026rsquo;m most comfortable with deployment on it. I automated the deployment of the cloud infrastructure with Terraform.\n.NET Core 3.1 MSSQL Snowflake Angular 2 Telerik Kendo UI Clean Architecture Azure AD Azure CI/CD GitHub GitHub Actions Terraform Docker ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/work-experience/","section":"Work Experience","summary":"1. 11.","title":"Work Experience"}]

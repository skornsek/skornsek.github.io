I'm a full stack software engineer who enjoys writing clean maintainable code and solving problems. I like to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. During my last job at [In516ht](https://www.in516ht.com/), I mostly developed software for banks using .NET Core, Angular, and MSSQL. 

I am always searching for ways to improve my workflow so I like to build CI/CD pipelines, that help me automate deployments and improve software quality with automated testing.

In my free time, I like to use my skills on side projects that improve my day to day life. These side projects sometimes involve the use of microcontrollers that can control things in the physical world.

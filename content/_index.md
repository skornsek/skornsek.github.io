I'm a full stack software engineer who enjoys writing clean maintainable code and solving problems. I like to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. During my last job at [In516ht](https://www.in516ht.com/), I mostly developed software for banks using .NET Core, Angular, and MSSQL. 

I am always searching for ways to improve my workflow so I like to build CI/CD pipelines, that help me automate deployments and improve software quality with automated testing.

I also built a couple of websites for my friends and I like to work on some side projects that improve my day to day life just for fun :construction_worker:
